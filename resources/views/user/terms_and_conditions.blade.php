                    <p><strong>1) Browsing the Marketplace:</strong></p>
                    <p>Viewers will use the Marketplace as a virtual mall where they can browse various shops and find mobile devices for their needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>2) Account Creation:</strong></p>
                    <p>Viewers must create an account with necessary details and can use it to shortlist devices they are interested in.</p>

                    <p><strong>3) Customer Relationship:</strong></p>
                    <p>Once a purchase is made, the viewer becomes a direct customer of the Vendor and not the Marketplace.</p>

                    <p><strong>4) Area-wise Listing:</strong></p>
                    <p>Vendors are listed based on area proximity selected by the viewer. Viewers can select a device and then contact the Vendor for further inquiries.</p>

                    <p><strong>5) Vendor Independence:</strong></p>
                    <p>Vendors listed on the Marketplace are independent subscribers and not employees or managers of the Company or the Marketplace.</p>

                    <p><strong>6) Caution - Fair Pricing:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>6.3:</strong> Vendors must clearly notify if the device being sold is open-box or refurbished to avoid any misrepresentation.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>7) Communication:</strong></p>
                    <p>Vendors are prohibited from making unsolicited calls or sending bulk communications to Viewers who have shown interest in their products. Repeated messaging will be treated as spam, and the Vendor may face penalties.</p>

                    <p><strong>8) False Endorsement:</strong></p>
                    <p>Vendors cannot falsely represent themselves as employees or representatives of the Company or the Marketplace to influence sales. Any violation will be treated as an offense under appropriate laws.</p>

                    <p><strong>9) Disputes:</strong></p>
